# Improved Soundtrack

This is an audio mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

Improved Soundtrack improves the game's audiospace by adding more (or adding back previously lost) music event triggers. Allowing you to hear more of the game's rarer and beautiful pieces of music as you explore the world.

* Added back New Location Discovered stingers. Three static choices or random.
* Blizzard and heavy fog music tracks. 
* Trepidation now plays more frequently.
* Clearing now plays more frequently.
* Delay between tracks so they don't play too frequently.
* Added Episode 3 exploration music to Pleasant Valley
* Removed wolf stalking music
* Customizable with the Mod Settings menu.

## Known Issues

* Last known play time of music tracks (with the exception of Trepidation) is not saved in the save file. Meaning it will carry over across saves and be reset for all saves when the game restarts.
